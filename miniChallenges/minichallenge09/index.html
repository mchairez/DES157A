        <h1>Mini Challenge 9</h1>
    </header>

    <p>For this challenge, write a script so that when the mouse rolls over the header, the h1 heading inside the header spins. When you roll the mouse off the header, the h1 heading inside the header stops spinning.</p>

    <p>Note that the class with the animation you need is already on the stylesheet. To get this to work you will need to add two variables that hold references to the h1 heading and the header. Then add two event listeners to the header. The first adds the rotate class to the the h1 heading on mouseover, and the second removes this class on mouseout.</p>

    <p>Take a screen shot of the JavaScript file and the web page with the heading spinning, and turn them in, along with a submission comment that indicates your level (1-4) as described on Canvas.</p>
