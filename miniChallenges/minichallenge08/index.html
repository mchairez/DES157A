        <h1>Mini Challenge 8</h1>
    </header>
    
    <p>For this challenge, add a script file with the IIFE and link it in the head of the page. Then make a variable that references <a href="http://google.com" id="link">this link to Google</a>, and a variable that references the empty div below.</p> 
    
    <p>Then attach an event handler to that variable that captures a click of the link by a user. Pass the special event object into an anonymous function that runs when the event handler is clicked and use that event object to prevent the default behavior, so the link doesn't acctually go to Google. Instead, make the link insert the text on the chicken.txt page into the empty div below instead.</p>

    <div id="video"></div>
    
    <p>Take a screen shot of the JavaScript file and the web page with the chicken video showing and turn them both in.</p>
