                    <p>Denzel Curry's fifth studio album, Melt My Eyez, is a 45 minute long hip hop album that has incredible production and lots of variety in sound. The album is amazingly cohesive and the cassette itself has to be one of the top 3 prettiest ones I own.</p>

                    <p>Japanese jazz and bossa nova band, Lamp, released their For Lovers album just a year after I was born in 2004. This was their second studio album and the first album of theirs I ever listened to in full. It is my favorite out of their collection and very nostalgic in nature. </p>

                    <p>Whitney by Whitney Houston, is her sophomore studio album, immediatly following her arguably most famous album (her debut). I can't say I know the tracks on this cassette as well as I do the others on this list, but growing up with parents who almost exclusively listen to 80's music, seeing this cassette sitting in a basket at a flea market felt like a no brainer to purchase.</p>

                    <p>Positions by Ariana Grande is her 6th studio album and is highly underrated, though a lot of her most recognizable hit singles came from this album. This cassette was also purchased by a friend who knew I listened to Ariana as a gift for getting through the academic quarter. </p>

                    <p>The Perfect Red Velvet is girl group, Red Velvet's, sophomore album and though the genre is categorized as K-pop, it has a really heavy R&B sound that is a bit sensual or rather just smooth and easy to listen to. This is an album I find myself falling back into a lot during the winter months because of how warm the music feels. </p>

                    <p>Depression Cherry is Beach House's 5th studio album. They fall into a kind of dream pop/shoe gaze hybrid category but have an incredibly polished sound that feels specific to them. The transluscent red of the cassette tape is my personal favorite and I find this one to be the prettiest out of all the ones I own.</p>

                    <h2>Punisher (2020)</h2>
                    <p>Punisher by Phoebe Bridgers is probably her most famous/ recognized album to date. For the time, it was a quite indie and I enjoyed listening to her music a lot during the nights of the early pandemic because despite being a bit haunting it was very mellow and almost comforting. </p>

                    <p>HELLO by Joy is the first on this list to be a debut piece of work. It technically categorizes an EP because it only has 6 songs, but it is so rare to find contemporary K-pop artist's merchandise in cassette form; I bought it more for the fear that I would never be able to purchase it again if I didn't get it in the moment. </p>

                    <h2>Laurel Hell (2022)</h2>
                    <p>Laurel Hell by Mitski was the first cassette that I had ever bought; I think I bought it even before I had a cassette player. This was one of my top played albums during my freshman year of university. The variety in this album is incredibly it has a bit of 80's influence but still keeps to her signature depressing, indie-pop style.  </p>

                    <p>So!yoON!'s sophomore album,[Episode1 - LOVE], has to be one of my favorite albums on this list. I usually never bother buying an album in more than one medium because I think its a waste of money but, I absolutely caved with purchasing this one as both a CD and a Vinyl. It's diverse, gorgeous, and an absolute masterpiece. </p>

I'm not a big anime fan myself but both the aesthetics, reminiscent of the fashion from the late 90's Sex Pistols, and the music which is reminiscent of the loser-core rock from Deftones/Evanescence was super intriguing. </p>

                    <h2>Ctrl (2017)</h2>
                    <p>SZA's debut album is an absolute masterpiece that does not get the credit it deserves. Ashamed to say, I didn't appreciate it as much as I should have until this year; it has so much nostalgia woven into it, for a second I actually do feel like I will be young forever.  </p>

                    <h2>Volcano (2023)</h2>
                    <p> This is THE SUMMER ALBUM. I could not even begin to describe to you what genre Jungle is, especially with how experiemental this album is. Electronic? Alternative? Indie? Whatever, if you like to dance and got a little bit of 70s vibe in you, this is for you. </p>

                    <h2>Heaven or Las Vegas (1990)</h2>
                    <p> Some of the biggest leaders of the shoegaze/dream pop sub-genre, The Cocteau Twins are a once in a life time talent. I love this album to pieces; it is perfect for every season, every feeling, every time of day. </p>

                    <h2>The 1975 (2013)</h2>
                    <p>The 1975 is the musical embodiment of all alternative, hipster, indie millenials on Tumblr during 2013 and for some reason growing up, I wanted to be these people so bad. Whenever, I listen to this album I feel exactly like my middle school self pretensiously pretending I was in a coming of age movie.</p>

                    <p>Thee Sacred Souls' self titled album is contemporary classic Soul/R&B album. It takes heavy influence from 60s and 70s classics like Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, and Al Green.</p>

                    <p>One of two Kali Uchis albums in this column, I must admit this one is my favorite. It has a very sultry, smooth vibe to it but still has a bunch of upbeat love type songs; I play this one every Valentines Day. </p>

                    <p>While this isn't my favorite Lana del Rey album, I honestly would have to say that this is objectively the best one. I know her music, being as soft and slow as it is, isn't for everyone but for the girlies who have never gotten over anything in their whole lives this one is for you. </p>

                    <h2>Orquideas (2024)</h2>
                    <p>Her most diverse piece of work, Kali Uchis most recent album Orquideas features genres like Reggaeton, Synth pop, and even throws in a little bit of merengue. Absolutely banger of an album. </p>

                    <h2>Melodrama (2017)</h2>
                    <p>Arguably, Lorde's best work, this album is a must listen. If you've ever experienced the fear of growing up too fast and not knowing what you're doing.. or if you have ever been a teen really; this album is for you. </p>
