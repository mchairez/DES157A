                <h2>Melt My Eyez See Your Future (2022)</h2>
                <p>Denzel Curry's fifth studio album, Melt My Eyez, is a 45 minute long hip hop album that has incredible production and lots of variety in sound. This cassette was actually gifted to me by a friend who knew that I collected them and wanted to give me a chance to listen to one of his favorite albums through one of my favorite mediums. The album is amazingly cohesive and the cassette itself has to be one of the top 3 prettiest ones I own.</p>

                <h2>For Lovers (2004)</h2>
                <p>Japanese jazz and bossa nova band, Lamp, released their For Lovers album just a year after I was born in 2004. This was their second studio album and the first album of theirs I ever listened to in full. It is my favorite out of their collection and very nostalgic in nature. It is also the most recent cassette in my collection, having bought it at one of their tour stops when they came to Sacramento back in September. They even performed some songs off this album, a full 20 years after its release. </p>

                <h2>Whitney (1987)</h2>
                <p>Whitney by Whitney Houston, is her sophomore studio album, immediatly following her arguably most famous album (her debut). I can't say I know the tracks on this cassette as well as I do the others on this list, but growing up with parents who almost exclusively listen to 80's music, seeing this cassette sitting in a basket at a flea market felt like a no brainer to purchase.</p>

                <h2>Positions (2020)</h2>
                <p>Positions by Ariana Grande is her 6th studio album and though it is highly underrated, a lot of her most recognizable hit singles came from this album. This cassette was also purchased by a friend who knew I listened to Ariana as a gift for getting through the academic quarter. This was probably the first cassette of many that was every gifted to me and so I have a special place in my heart for this one.  </p>

                <h2>The Perfect Red Velvet (2018)</h2>
                <p>The Perfect Red Velvet is girl group, Red Velvet's, sophomore album and though the genre is categorized as K-pop, it has a really heavy R&B sound that is a bit sensual or rather just smooth and easy to listen to. This is an album I find myself falling back into a lot during the winter months because of how warm the music feels. However, it is quite impossible to get contemporary artists on cassette lately as it is a dying medium, especially with more niche artists like this, so I purchased this one online from a small business (for being bootleg it still sounds pretty decent). </p>

                <h2>Depression Cherry (2015)</h2>
                <p>Depression Cherry is Beach House's 5th studio album. They fall into a kind of dream pop/shoe gaze hybrid category but have an incredibly polished sound that feels specific to them. A lot of their music has been sampled by bigger artists such as the Weeknd and Kendrick Lamar, which speaks to their versatility and production quality. I am perhaps a bit biased but the transluscent red of the cassette tape is my personal favorite and I find this one to be the prettiest out of all the ones I own.</p>

                <h2>I'm Breathless (1990)</h2>
                <p>An iconic pop star like Madonna needs no introduction. I grew up with a lot of her music, being that my parents always kept a CD of her biggest hits in the car player all the time. I am less familiar with the works of this album than I am compared to her other albums like her self-titled "Madonna" or "True Blue" (which I also have on cassette), but when I saw "Vogue" which is (one of..) my all time favorite song of hers, I knew I had to get it.</p>

                <h2>Punisher (2020)</h2>
                <p>Punisher by Phoebe Bridgers is probably her most famous/ recognized album to date. For the time, it was a quite indie and I enjoyed listening to her music a lot during the nights of the early pandemic because despite being a bit haunting it was very mellow and almost comforting. The juxtaposition between the color of the cassette and the colors on the cover I think make it all the more worth it; I think it really gives that kind of slightly disurbing, chilling vibe. </p>

                <h2>HELLO (2021)</h2>
                <p>HELLO by Joy is the first on this list to be a debut piece of work. It technically categorizes an EP because it only has 6 songs, but it is so rare to find contemporary K-pop artist's merchandise in cassette form; I bought it more for the fear that I would never be able to purchase it again if I didn't get it in the moment. Though this is one of my sister's favorite EP's to listen to so I still think it was a win. </p>

                <h2>Laurel Hell (2022)</h2>
                <p>Laurel Hell by Mitski was the first cassette that I had ever bought; I think I bought it even before I had a cassette player. This was one of my top played albums during my freshman year of university. The variety in this album is incredibly it has a bit of 80's influence but still keeps to her signature depressing, indie-pop style. I love every single song of this album and I think I would say this is one of the cassettes that I have reached for the most over the years. </p>
