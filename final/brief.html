                <p>I am choosing to update the everyPicture Project because I feel that there were so many different directions I wanted to take the “room tour” theme that I didn’t get to fully explore due to time constraints and I want to be able to go more in depth on the individual collections that I highlighted in my current one.  </p>
                <p>For this next iteration of the project I want to have the site incorporate more motion to engage the audience more. My current thought is to have my home page be a picture of room; just like it was in the original iteration but once you click on the photo it automatically makes the user scroll down to the “archive” portion of the page that features different items of the same collections (e.g. my vinyl, cassette, seashell collection). I want to make sure, though, that every collection has its own separate row/ area where all the pictures glide across the screen in a row like a moving gallery.</p>
                <p>I think I am primarily going to focus on enhancing the design/aesthetics of the process with a secondary focus if improving the UI/UX of the page. That being said, I am thinking of contacting Professor Housefield and Professor Wheeler; the latter being the most certain because, he has experience in both design and UI/UX so I think his feedback specifically will be a bit more on the nose for what I am doing. </p>
