                    <figcaption>Fig.1 - The Grand, 1st Street, Downtown Los Angeles (2022)</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                <p>My collection revolves around urban architecture from the ant's eye view. This image is the one that actually inspired the collection as it was the first one of all the images I took. I took this in the winter of 2022 right around New Year on my way to visit an exchibition at the MOMA in downtown. This particular building I found to be super striking because of the way the different parts of the building are sectioned off. They look like rubiks cubes stacked upon each other in no particular order. At the time that I took this picture, The Grand was still in construction and so all the glass and paneling was entirely new and I think that made it even more striking to see something so tall and yet to be met with the forces of weather and time. I am not sure what this archive might say about me but perhaps it might convey the way that I see the world and also my soft spot for architecture. </p>

                    <figcaption>Fig.2 - Yena Won, 2013</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                <p>This to me conveys a core memory of some sort. It reminds of the pictures I would take with my little siblings and cousins when were still children together. The quality reminds of the that of like a DS, ipod, or just older generation of iphone. In that way, I think its kind of nostalgic, the lighting is dull but warm. It's just a picture between family on a warm night of someone's home. The only thing I feel like I don't know from this image is who these people are. I can't say with certainty I know any of their names though I can guess that the oldest one is Yena, that is about as far as I can reach. But what I think IS obvious, is not who they are but who they are to each other. This is the kind of core memory of childhood that could be done in a million ways by a million different families but will never be replicated exactly. </p>

                <a href= "https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/"> 10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a>
                <p>I don’t think I had ever stopped to think about how much context can change the meaning of a picture until I read this article. While I am guilty of skimming certain items, as the article mentions young people often do, I almost always make sure to look at any pictures provided and read their captions as sometimes I feel like they are a quicker way of getting the gist of things. I think also as designers, we are taught that whatever images, projects, etc. that we produce should be easily understood by our audience– which doesn’t necessarily translate to “simple” but can be misunderstood to be so. While this may seem unrelated, I feel like it made me realize how I don’t really ever find myself trying to read more into pictures that are complex because my mentality has just been to subconsciously make simple answers out of them. </p>
                
                <a href="https://i2-camera.polaroid.com/en_us">Polaroid I-2 US Website</a>
                <p>However, after sifting through a few websites, I’ve found that the way people use pictures to interact with their audience can be both simple and complex at the same time. For example Polaroid’s website will have something as straightforward as a few polaroids stacked atop each other but as you scroll down, the polaroids will lift up from the stack one by one, and reveal the one beneath it in an animated gesture. Not only is this impressive but it takes an almost ordinary, unassuming situation and makes it fun and dynamic for the user to interact with. </p>

                <a href= "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes </a>
                <p>The discourse revolved around the misuse of lightboxes is not one that I see often brought up in conversation but it is something I think most people encounter in their daily lives while navigating the web or modern platforms in general. One of the points that resonated with me the most was the emphasis on making sure that there is an inherently obvious way to navigate/ close the lightbox. I feel that this is an issue that encounter often where I have the search the entire parameters of the lightbox for a barely visible, super low contrast, tiny x or the "close" hyperlink that is visibly 10 times smaller than the "shop now" (for example) button. Not only is this frustrating for users but it also crosses the line into decreasing userability. For older generations more unfamiliar with technology or those who may be vision impaired, these characteristics of modern web may be especially difficult. </p>
                <p>Other points about lightboxes conveying urgency, I do find to be partially true as I believe that is what they were intended for. However, it would also not be accurate to say in regards to the way they are used modernly which I would argue is now mostly associated with adds. </p>

                <h2>Journal Entry 1</h2>
                <a href= "https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design Article </a>
                <p>In the article, the author made a lot of statements regarding usability through the perspective of the user that I resonated with a lot. I had an experience yesterday where I was looking to make an optometry appointment and even after spending 10-15 minutes looking for the information to make the appointment; when I got to the last step of filling out a long form with too many input values, no distinguishable optional vs required fields, and excessive use of drop down menus, I felt really inclined to turn away because I felt overwhelmed with amount of effort I, as a user, would have to put in to complete it. All of these qualities, as mentioned in the article, not only overwhelms the users but decreases the likelihood of users actually completing the form. I think a lot of forms made in more recent years suffer from similar issues, such as teacher evaluations. Despite them being very obviously helpful and beneficial, their lengthiness often turns away students who may not have more than a few minutes to spare. </p>
                <p>Forms are a tradeoff, you give your time and effort in exchange for the acquired result and often the time and effort required ends up feeling imbalanced and can convince the user that they really do not need whatever it was they originally intended to fill out the form for. I think being more mindful of incorporating proper user design and implementing more of these practices would change the way that users perceive and interact with forms as a whole. </a></p>
            
                <a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/">Best Example for Form Usability</a>
                <p>I think Rate My professor probably has one of the most user friendly and best examples of what a form should look like. When you go to fill out the review form; it provides a really good variety of input values that feel very straight forward with low effortー to the point where when you submit you ask yourself “that’s it?”. </p>
