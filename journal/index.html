                <a href= "https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design Article </a>
                <p>In the article, the author made a lot of statements regarding usability through the perspective of the user that I resonated with a lot. I had an experience yesterday where I was looking to make an optometry appointment and even after spending 10-15 minutes looking for the information to make the appointment; when I got to the last step of filling out a long form with too many input values, no distinguishable optional vs required fields, and excessive use of drop down menus, I felt really inclined to turn away because I felt overwhelmed with amount of effort I, as a user, would have to put in to complete it. All of these qualities, as mentioned in the article, not only overwhelms the users but decreases the likelihood of users actually completing the form. I think a lot of forms made in more recent years suffer from similar issues, such as teacher evaluations. Despite them being very obviously helpful and beneficial, their lengthiness often turns away students who may not have more than a few minutes to spare. Forms are a tradeoff, you give your time and effort in exchange for the acquired result and often the time and effort required ends up feeling imbalanced and can convince the user that they really do not need whatever it was they originally intended to fill out the form for. I think being more mindful of incorporating proper user design and implementing more of these practices would change the way that users perceive and interact with forms as a whole. </a></p>

                <p>I think Rate My professor probably has one of the most user friendly and best examples of what a form should look like. When you go to fill out the review form; it provides a really good variety of input values that feel very straight forward with low effortー to the point where when you submit you ask yourself “that’s it?”. </p>
